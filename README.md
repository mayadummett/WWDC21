Winning submission for WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge

In my Swift playground, the primary technology I used is UIKit. UIKit does quite a few jobs in my Swift playground. 

For one, UIKit allows my Swift playground to return and display an image to the user. To be specific, my Swift playground revolves around a chatbot named "M" who is hoping to encourage the user to pursue STEM. M the Chatbot's conversation with the user is one that I wish someone would have had with me years ago. It is UIKit that allows the user to see an emoji representation of M the Chatbot.  This helps to create a more personal element to the chatbot and the conversation that follows with it. 

Beyond that smaller detail and onto more full technical aspects, UIKit powers the entire chatbot as UIKit permits the user to respond to the prompts of the chatbot. M the Chatbot speaks to her experiences in STEM and then checks in with the user to see how the user might relate STEM to an already existing passion of theirs. These responses then allow the chatbot to interact with the user, taking into account the user's input and responding along the lines of that input.

For example, my Swift playground requests the passion of the user. In this, UIKit provides the interface for the user to respond with that passion. Then with both UIKit and my Swift code, the program/chatbot then reacts with "Did you know that you can combine almost anything in STEM with [user's passion]? What do you think about that?" UIKit allows and encourages the user to imagine their passion's intersection with STEM.
With UIKit, this interaction of input and output between the chatbot and the user continues on and on until the program is complete.
